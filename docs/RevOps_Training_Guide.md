# RevOps Training Guide: Understanding RBIA Compiler Errors

## Task 6.2.78: Docs & Training for RevOps Personas

### Overview
This guide helps Revenue Operations professionals understand and respond to RBIA compiler errors effectively. The RBIA (Rule-Based Intelligence Automation) system compiles business workflows into executable plans, and this guide translates technical compiler messages into actionable business language.

## Quick Reference: Common Error Types

### ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL ERRORS** - Block Execution
These errors prevent your workflow from running and require immediate attention.

| Error Code | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `MISSING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | ML decision lacks confidence settings | Set minimum confidence level (recommend 80%) |
| `NO_FALLBACK_PLAN` | No backup plan for ML failures | Add manual review or rule-based fallback |
| `SECURITY_VIOLATION` | Security policy not met | Contact IT/Security team |
| `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` | Change needs business approval | Route to appropriate approver |

### ðŸŸ¡ **WARNING ERRORS** - Review Recommended
These allow execution but may cause issues later.

| Error Code | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `LOW_CONFIDENCE_ML` | ML model uncertainty is high | Consider adding human review step |
| `COST_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED` | Workflow may be expensive | Review cost estimates and optimize |
| `DATA_QUALITY_CONCERN` | Input data may have issues | Validate data sources |

## Error Categories Explained

### 1. **ML Model Errors**
**What they are:** Issues with machine learning components in your workflow.

**Common scenarios:**
- "The lead scoring model needs a confidence threshold"
- "No fallback plan if the model fails"
- "Model predictions need human oversight"

**RevOps Action:**
1. **Set confidence levels:** Decide minimum confidence for auto-execution (typically 80-90%)
2. **Define fallbacks:** What happens when ML fails? (manual review, default rules)
3. **Plan oversight:** When do humans need to review ML decisions?

### 2. **Business Rule Errors**
**What they are:** Problems with your business logic and decision rules.

**Common scenarios:**
- "Missing approval step for high-value deals"
- "No rule for handling edge cases"
- "Conflicting business rules"

**RevOps Action:**
1. **Review business logic:** Ensure rules match current processes
2. **Add missing steps:** Include all required approval/review steps
3. **Handle exceptions:** Define what happens in unusual cases

### 3. **Data & Integration Errors**
**What they are:** Issues connecting to your CRM, databases, or other systems.

**Common scenarios:**
- "Cannot connect to Salesforce"
- "Missing required customer data"
- "Data format doesn't match expectations"

**RevOps Action:**
1. **Check integrations:** Verify system connections are working
2. **Validate data:** Ensure required fields are populated
3. **Contact IT:** For technical integration issues

### 4. **Compliance & Security Errors**
**What they are:** Violations of company policies, regulations, or security requirements.

**Common scenarios:**
- "GDPR compliance check failed"
- "Customer data residency violation"
- "Unauthorized access to sensitive data"

**RevOps Action:**
1. **Review policies:** Ensure workflow follows company guidelines
2. **Check permissions:** Verify proper access controls
3. **Consult compliance:** Involve legal/compliance team if needed

## Step-by-Step Error Resolution

### Step 1: Identify the Error Type
Look for these keywords in the error message:
- **"Missing"** â†’ Something required is not configured
- **"Failed"** â†’ A check or validation didn't pass
- **"Exceeded"** â†’ A limit or threshold was crossed
- **"Unauthorized"** â†’ Permission or security issue

### Step 2: Understand Business Impact
Ask yourself:
- Will this affect customer experience?
- Could this cause compliance issues?
- Will this impact revenue or operations?
- Does this require immediate action?

### Step 3: Take Appropriate Action
**For Critical Errors:**
1. Stop deployment/execution
2. Fix the issue before proceeding
3. Test the fix
4. Get necessary approvals

**For Warnings:**
1. Assess business risk
2. Decide if fix is needed now or later
3. Document the decision
4. Schedule fix if needed

### Step 4: Prevent Future Issues
- Document the solution
- Update team processes
- Consider training needs
- Review similar workflows

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: "ML Model Confidence Too Low"
**Error:** `ML_CONFIDENCE_BELOW_THRESHOLD`

**What it means:** The AI model isn't confident enough in its predictions.

**Business Impact:** Could lead to poor decisions or customer dissatisfaction.

**Solution:**
1. Increase confidence threshold to 85-90%
2. Add human review for low-confidence cases
3. Consider retraining the model with more data

**RevOps Action Items:**
- [ ] Set minimum confidence level
- [ ] Define review process for uncertain cases
- [ ] Schedule model performance review

### Scenario 2: "Missing Approval Gate"
**Error:** `APPROVAL_GATE_REQUIRED`

**What it means:** High-risk changes need manager approval but none is configured.

**Business Impact:** Could bypass important business controls.

**Solution:**
1. Add approval step for high-value/high-risk items
2. Define who needs to approve what
3. Set up notification system for approvers

**RevOps Action Items:**
- [ ] Define approval matrix (who approves what)
- [ ] Configure approval workflow
- [ ] Set up approver notifications

### Scenario 3: "Data Integration Failure"
**Error:** `EXTERNAL_API_CONNECTION_FAILED`

**What it means:** Cannot connect to CRM, marketing automation, or other systems.

**Business Impact:** Workflow cannot access needed customer data.

**Solution:**
1. Check system status and connectivity
2. Verify API credentials and permissions
3. Test connection and data flow

**RevOps Action Items:**
- [ ] Contact IT/system administrator
- [ ] Verify system credentials
- [ ] Test data connections
- [ ] Set up monitoring for future issues
