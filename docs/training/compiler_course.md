**Target Audience:** RevOps Managers, Compliance Officers, Business Analysts  
**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of business workflows  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will:
1. Understand how the RBIA compiler transforms business rules into executable workflows
2. Know how to read and validate compiler outputs for compliance
3. Recognize governance controls and policy enforcement mechanisms
4. Troubleshoot common compilation errors
5. Ensure workflows meet regulatory requirements

---

## Module 1: Compiler Fundamentals (60 minutes)

### 1.1 What is the RBIA Compiler?
- **Purpose:** Transforms human-readable DSL into executable workflow plans
- **Input:** YAML workflow definitions with business rules
- **Output:** Validated, secure, auditable execution plans
- **Key Benefit:** Ensures governance and compliance are built-in, not bolted-on

### 1.2 Compilation Process Overview
```
DSL Input → Parser → Type Checker → Policy Binder → Optimizer → Code Generator → Executable Plan
```

**Why This Matters for RevOps:**
- Every workflow is validated for compliance before execution
- No manual oversight needed - governance is automatic
- Audit trails are generated automatically

### 1.3 Key Components You Need to Know
1. **Parser:** Reads your YAML workflows
2. **Policy Binder:** Enforces SOX, GDPR, and other compliance rules
3. **Type Checker:** Prevents data type errors that could cause wrong decisions
4. **Evidence Generator:** Creates audit trails automatically

### 1.4 Hands-On Exercise
Review a sample workflow compilation log and identify:
- Where governance policies were applied
- What validation checks passed/failed
- How evidence was captured

---

## Module 2: Reading Compiler Output (45 minutes)

### 2.1 Understanding Compilation Reports
When you submit a workflow, the compiler generates:
- **Validation Report:** Shows all checks performed
- **Policy Report:** Lists which compliance rules were applied
- **Evidence Manifest:** Documents what will be audited
- **Execution Plan:** The final workflow ready to run

### 2.2 Critical Fields for Compliance Teams
Always verify these fields in compilation output:
```yaml
governance:
  tenant_id: "required - isolates data"
  region_id: "required - data residency"
  policy_pack: "required - compliance framework"
  evidence_capture: true  # Must be true for audit
  
trust_budget:
  confidence_threshold: 0.8  # Minimum for auto-execution
  assisted_mode_below: 0.7   # When human review required
```

### 2.3 Spotting Compliance Issues
Red flags in compiler output:
- ❌ Missing `evidence_capture: true`
- ❌ No fallback configuration for ML nodes
- ❌ Missing policy_pack reference
- ❌ Confidence thresholds below company standards

### 2.4 Exercise: Compliance Validation
Practice reviewing compilation reports and identifying compliance gaps.

## Module 3: Governance and Policy Enforcement (75 minutes)

### 3.1 How Policies Are Applied
The compiler automatically enforces:
- **SOX Controls:** Segregation of duties, approval workflows, evidence retention
- **GDPR Requirements:** Data residency, consent validation, purpose limitation
- **Company Policies:** Risk thresholds, escalation rules, SLA requirements

### 3.2 Policy Pack Structure
```yaml
sox_financial_controls:
  segregation_of_duties: true
  approval_required: true
  approver_roles: ["finance_manager", "cfo"]
  evidence_retention_years: 7
  
gdpr_data_privacy:
  data_residency: "eu_west"
  consent_required: true
  purpose_limitation: true
  retention_limit_days: 730
```

### 3.3 Understanding Fallback Mechanisms
Every ML decision must have a fallback:
```yaml
fallback:
  enabled: true
  fallback:
    - type: "rba_rule"        # Falls back to deterministic rule
      target: "manual_review"  # If rule fails, goes to human
      condition: "confidence < 0.7"
```

**Why This Matters:** Ensures business continuity even if AI fails.

### 3.4 Trust Budgets and Risk Management
```yaml
trust_budget:
  min_trust_score: 0.8      # Minimum trust to proceed
  decay_rate: 0.1           # How trust decreases over time
  recovery_threshold: 0.9   # When to restore full trust
```

### 3.5 Exercise: Policy Configuration
Configure policy packs for different business scenarios.

## Module 4: Troubleshooting and Error Resolution (60 minutes)

### 4.1 Common Compilation Errors

**Error Type: Missing Governance Fields**
```
DSL201: Missing governance metadata
Required: tenant_id, region_id, policy_pack
```
**Fix:** Add all required governance fields to workflow definition.

**Error Type: Policy Violation**
```
DSL301: SOX compliance failure - missing approval workflow
```
**Fix:** Add approval steps for financial workflows over threshold.

**Error Type: Missing Fallback**
```
DSL302: ML node without fallback configuration
```
**Fix:** Add fallback array with at least one deterministic option.

### 4.2 Validation Checklist
Before submitting workflows, verify:
- [ ] All governance fields present
- [ ] Policy pack matches business requirements
- [ ] ML nodes have fallback configurations
- [ ] Confidence thresholds meet company standards
- [ ] Evidence capture enabled
- [ ] Appropriate SLA tier selected

### 4.3 Working with the Compiler Team
When to escalate:
- Compilation errors you can't resolve
- Policy pack needs updating
- New compliance requirements
- Performance issues

### 4.4 Exercise: Error Resolution
Practice fixing common compilation errors in sample workflows.

## Module 5: Best Practices and Advanced Topics (40 minutes)

### 5.1 Workflow Design Best Practices
- **Keep it Simple:** Fewer steps = fewer failure points
- **Clear Naming:** Use descriptive IDs and names
- **Document Intent:** Add comments explaining business logic
- **Test Thoroughly:** Use sandbox mode before production

### 5.2 Performance Considerations
- Avoid deeply nested workflows (>10 levels)
- Use appropriate SLA tiers (T0 for critical, T2 for routine)
- Consider batch processing for high-volume operations

### 5.3 Security Best Practices
- Never hardcode sensitive data
- Use secret references instead of literals
- Validate all external inputs
- Enable evidence capture for audit trails

### 5.4 Staying Current
- Subscribe to compiler update notifications
- Review new policy packs quarterly
- Participate in compliance training updates
- Monitor error telemetry for improvement opportunities

## Assessment and Certification

### Knowledge Check (20 questions)
1. What are the three mandatory governance fields?
2. When is assisted mode triggered?
3. How long are evidence packs retained for SOX compliance?
4. What happens if an ML node has no fallback?
5. [Additional questions...]

### Practical Exercise
Configure a complete workflow with:
- Proper governance metadata
- ML decision node with fallback
- Appropriate policy pack
- Evidence capture enabled
