### 1.2 Evolution Pathways

#### Forward Evolution (Promotion)
- **RBA → RBIA**: When deterministic rules can benefit from ML augmentation
- **RBIA → AALA**: When ML decisions require reasoning and context awareness
- **Direct RBA → AALA**: For highly complex scenarios requiring full autonomy

#### Backward Evolution (Demotion)
- **AALA → RBIA**: When agent performance degrades or safety concerns arise
- **RBIA → RBA**: When ML models fail or deterministic alternatives are better
- **Emergency Fallback**: Any type → RBA for safety and compliance
